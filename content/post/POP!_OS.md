POP uses COSMIC, a backronym for Computer Operating System Main Interface Components, is a free and open-source desktop environment for Linux and other Unix-like operating systems. COSMIC was originally the name of a modified version of GNOME made specifically for Pop!

I'm finding it damn fast and it's clean and uncluttered. Plus I hate notifications and it's so refreshingly quiet after I nuked Windows 11 in frustration.

If I am missing anything it's a Guake style dropdown terminal but apprently that's not just me with that feature request so we'll see..

Pop!_OS 24.04 LTS, featuring the new Rust-based COSMIC desktop as its default environment, was officially released on 11 December 2025. The release followed Ubuntu 24.04 LTS and marked the first stable deployment of COSMIC, introducing core applications such as Files, Store, and Terminal built specifically for the new desktop environment.

The COSMIC (Computer Operating System Main Interface Components) desktop environment, developed by System76, is a new, Rust-based, and Wayland-native desktop environment designed for high performance, stability, and workflow customization. It is designed to be highly efficient, especially for professional workflows like development. 

## Key advantages of the COSMIC desktop environment include:

 - Performance and Stability (Built in Rust): COSMIC is built from scratch using the Rust programming language, which enhances memory safety and stability compared to traditional C/C++ environments. It offers improved responsiveness and reduces, or eliminates, system freezes and crashes.
   
-  Highly Flexible Tiling: COSMIC offers "automatic" tiling that is customizable by the user, rather than a rigid, forced workflow. It allows for "stacking" windows (creating tabbed groups) within a tiled layout and allows for mixing tiled and floating windows in the same workspace.

- Native Wayland Compositor: As a native Wayland environment (using cosmic-comp), it removes X11 legacy baggage, leading to better security and smoother performance.
- Productivity-Focused UX: The desktop includes a powerful launcher (for search, calculations, and apps), advanced workspaces, and extensive keyboard shortcuts that can be tailored to individual user needs.
- Customization without Extensions: Unlike GNOME, which relies on sometimes-unstable extensions, COSMIC provides extensive, built-in customization options for panels, docks, and themes. Users can easily customize the appearance, including panel positioning and applet configuration.
 - Native Application Suite: COSMIC includes a suite of native apps built with the iced library, such as a file manager (COSMIC Files), terminal emulator (COSMIC Terminal), text editor (COSMIC Edit), and a new, faster app store (COSMIC Store).
- Advanced Multi-Monitor Support: It features superior multi-monitor support with individual workspace management on each monitor, a feature often missing or limited in other desktop environments.
- Deep Theming: The theming system supports custom color palettes, light/dark mode, and adjustable visual density (Spacious, Comfortable, Compact).
- Modern Features: COSMIC includes support for fractional scaling, modern gesture controls, and better handling of hybrid graphics, making it suitable for both high-performance and power-saving use cases.
